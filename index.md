The EPI 2023 - 18th Iberian Peptide Meeting will take place from the 27th to the 29th of
November, 2023. We are excited to host you at the seaside town of Sesimbra,
which we are sure will provide the perfect backdrop for three days of
scientific exchange.

The Iberian Peptide Meeting is a biannual event with a history spanning
decades, organized to foster exchange and collaboration between the Portuguese
and Spanish research communities working on peptide science. The meeting covers
varied fields, ranging from peptide synthesis to structural characterization
and to biological interactions and activity. 

Finally, as is tradition, focus is being put on facilitating attendance
by young researchers. This is done as a way to boost both researcher exposure
and networking, towards a stronger future community.
